		<p style="padding-left: 4em">
			Hi! My name's Josh and I'm a solo indie developer from the UK.<br /><br />

			I mostly take part in game jams, but maybe in the future you'll see some bigger projects.<br /><br />
			
			I've done a couple jams now and some bigger longer term projects. <br />
			I try to make games that are fun to play and have interesting ideas and mechanics behind them, even if they aren't executed perfectly.<br /> 
			I'm going to keep my old projects up so you can see the progress I've made and the ideas behind some of my less polished games.

			<h4>Origame</h4>

			<p>
				This game is my first published long-term project.<br /><br />
				<strong>Origame</strong> was a project I made for my A Level Computer Science course - I had to learn how to: analyse the market for a game; research 
				existing games within a similar genre; use UML to design complex systems accounting for concepts like cohesion and coupling; develop a
				solution in measured iterations, reviewing each prototype with the client; and evaluate the project according to a success criteria.

				<a href="https://itch.io/jam/ludwig-2021" target="_blank"> Ludwig Jam 2021</a> was a game jam hosted by Ludwig Ahgren, a popular streamer, 
				and Ottomated, a developer known for CrewLink.<br /><br />
				The theme was <strong>Foddian</strong>, a genre that Bennett Foddy popularised - punishing games where you can lose huge amounts of progress
				(for example: Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy, Jump King and Pogostuck). 
				<strong>Painball</strong> was created to be a frustrating version of pinball with these Foddian concepts built into it.

			<h4 style="color: black;">Hexatris</h4>

			<p style="color: black;">
				Ludum Dare is an infamous game jam - I'd heard of it even before becoming a developer, and <strong>Hexatris</strong> was my first 
				attempt at participating.<br /><br />
				<a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/49/hexatris" target="_blank">LD49</a> had the theme Unstable and so I built a small game
				where the purpose was to keep these hexagonal pieces stacked perfectly on a plinth. One of my buggier games, maybe because Ludum Dare's
				time frame was smaller than I was used to.

			<p style="color: black;">
				<a href="https://kenney.nl/assets" target="_blank">Kenney</a> is a talented and famous artist in the game dev community - their free asset 
				packs mean that developers without the talent time or money to create their own assets can still make good-looking games.<br /><br />
				This <a href="https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2021" target="_blank">jam</a> was hosted by Kenney had the theme <strong>Rotation</strong>, 
				and every entry had to use Kenney's assets.
				<strong>Balls in Holes</strong> was originally developed for the jam, but as time run out I continued to develop it, adding levels and usability features.

			<h4 style="color: white;">It's so aMAZEing</h4>

			<p style="color: white;">
				Only my second published game, <strong>It's so aMAZEing</strong> carries on the tradition of my games having really shit puns for names.<br /><br />
				This game was made for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2021" target="_blank">LowRezJam 2021</a>, where the challenge is to
				develop a fun game with any theme as long as the game window is 64x64 pixels.<br /><br />
				This project was my first time using Unity to make a 3D game, and I began learning the 3D modelling software Blender during the jam.

		<!-- Zombusiness -->
		<div class=game style="background-color: black;">
			<h4 style="color: white;">None of your Zombusiness</h4>

			<p style="color: white;">
				<strong>Zombusiness</strong> was my first (published) game!<br /><br />
				It's obviously not a masterpiece, but for my first game published for my <a href="https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-5" target="_blank">first game jam</a>, I was and still am extremely proud. 
				I set out with a bold idea I brainstormed with some friends, and built it up from there. 
				I didn't manage to deliver on the idea I had formed, but I learnt so much about time management, sensible scope, and publishing to Itch.io.<br /><br />
				It was the first time I could show friends something concrete I had built, something they could download and play, and the first time I
				experienced my work giving someone (fleeting) moments of joy.
